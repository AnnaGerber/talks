						You've probably heard of the internet of things.
<p>According to CISCO there are already more things than people on the internet and this number is only going to increase.</p>
<p>The web of things builds on the internet of things, by suggesting that we can connect IoT devices to each other and with the rest of the web using protocols, technologies, and approaches developed for the web e.g. HTTP and REST. These work well for connecting heterogenous web-apps and services, so the idea is they can also be used to connect heterogenous things.</p>

<p>Web apps that we design and develop will not only need to send and receive data from web of things devices, but also potentially be accessed from them - if you thought responsive design for mobile apps was difficult try designing for persistance of vision displays, Google glass, Pebble etc.</p>
<p>IoT is not all machine to machine (M2M) interaction - there is much we can contribute to UI / UX design of IoT devices especially wearables</p>

						There is also a trend towards using languages from the web e.g. JavaScript to program web of things devices. Here's a simple example: a TMP36 temperature sensor connected to an Arduino Nano microcontroller development board. Programmed using Johnny-Five, to poll sensor on analog pin 0 every three seconds and display the result on a web-based dashboard built using dashing-js.
						<p>This example needs to run on a host e.g. raspberry pi connected to the arduino via serial (e.g. bluetooth or usb)<p>We could easily add a REST interface using restify.. or publish the data to a service like Xively to provide Atom feeds, sharability, discoverability...

						<p>One of my biggest concerns about the way that the Web of Things is shaping up is that many of the devices that currently exist or that we can imagine gather highly personal, contextual information, and I believe it is very important that individuals retain control over who has access to that information and how they can use it.</p>
						<p>I think the solution is to look at open source, open hardware and open data movements. I love open source not only because using open source libraries and frameworks helps me to create better web apps, faster, but I love the culture of “let a thousand flowers bloom”. Having alternatives gives me freedom of choice over the tools that I use, and I can selectively  customise and scrutinize them. But the thing I love most about the open source / hardware / data movements is the community, which drives innovation and establishes expectations about what I should be able to do with the software / hardware / data that I use. So even if I choose to use proprietary solutions, those closed options are better (than they might otherwise have been) because of the open alternatives that are available.</p>
						<p>We’ve seen how what happens when vendors get in and create highly controlled, walled communities. Let’s not let that happen with IoT.</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>There is definitely progress being made on the open web of things but more people need to get involved. Platforms like the OSHW Arduino platform are convenient, and a great way to learn about hardware design and prototype web of things devices, but they are just a starting point - suggesting that every IoT project should use Arduino is like saying that every web app should be built using jQuery. There is plenty of room for alternatives, and as builders of the web we need to step up and start building them. To do this, we need to skill up or team up with someone who knows about hardware. Your local hackerspace, fab lab or tech shop is a great way to develop these connections.</p>

							<p>The web is going physical whether we like it, and whether we are ready for it or not.</p>

							<p>Right now there are no clear market leaders, lots of room for experimentation & opportunity but also no clear agreement on architecture - the internet of things is fragmented. I believe that by adopting standards and technologies that have been proven to work for the web and developing open solutions on top of them, together we can work towards building the web of things that we want, not one that we have to settle for.</p>
